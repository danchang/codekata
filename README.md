# codekata
This repository is for publishing sample runs of code kata exercises I do.  It was made specifically for collaboration and discussion with some of my fellow developers as part of our promotion of Software Craftsmanship.  However, I chose to make these specific examples public for whatever worth they have to the community.

Since these are meant to encourage discussion and refinement of the craft, I will do my best to provide commentary.
